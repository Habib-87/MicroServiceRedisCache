# MicroServiceRedisCache

To show how can we implement caching using Redis in Microservice. 

Install Redis in local before proceeding with this example. 
We have used Redis as a cache and backend as well. If you wish you can change the backend to different Database like Mongo or any other DB.For that you just need to change the repository layer.
